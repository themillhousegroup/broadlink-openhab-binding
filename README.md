broadlink-openhab-binding
=====

Introduction
------------
This is building on the work of Cato Sognen, who developed the original Broadlink OpenHAB binding, but 
never placed his source code into the public domain.

Known Issues
------------

The original binding worked extremely well but there were a couple of issues related to multiple-device support (especially after a restart) that need to be addressed before this can be considered a mature binding. Github's issue tracking will be used for the basic stuff (getting this library working at all) but the main aims of this library are:

- Make the source code of the binding publicly available for scrutiny and improvement
- Fix multiple-device support
- Remove reliance on IP addresses (the device MAC address is all that is really needed) 

These main aims are based on my own personal needs and from reading of the [relevant OpenHAB forum post](https://community.openhab.org/t/broadlink-binding-for-rmx-a1-spx-and-mp-any-interest/22768). As mentioned above, please use Github Issues to log additional bugs/feature requests.
